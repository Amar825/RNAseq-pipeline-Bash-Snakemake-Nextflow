# RNAseq-pipeline-Bash-Snakemake-Nextflow

This bioinformatic pipeline performs a basic RNA-seq analysis. We start by downloading the FASTQ files and end with a Differential Expression Genes list. I'll be using three different methods to do this:
1. Bash-linear
2. Snakemake
3. Nextflow

In every method, the fundamental processes are going to be the same, but there are going to be different ways to achieve that. Each method offers a unique value, which we shall experience on our own, and document like our lives depend on it.

This project is documented as if I am explaining this to a friend. No AI fluff, no big  and complex sentences.
I might write a medium article about it going in much details about the codes and stuff, but in this repo I will stick to explaining the **conceptual elements and rationale** behind every steps and parameters. So basically explaining the whys.
