# RNA seq pipeline (Bash-linear)

This is a bioinformatic pipeline that performs a basic RNA-seq analysis, we start by downloading the FASTQ files and end with a Differential Expression Genes list.

This project is documented as if I am explaining this to a friend. No AI fluff, no big  and complex sentences.
I might write a medium article about it going in much details about the codes and stuff, but in this repo I will stick to explaining the conceptual elements and rationale behind every steps and parameters. So basically explaining the whys.
